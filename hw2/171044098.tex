		\section{Why did I choose these topics?}
		\subsection{When I analyze our topics along the semester, I saw that these two topics are very important topics for probability, they are like \textbf{backbone of the probability} and lastly they are frequently used topics in real life. Also, I have chose 2 different topic, because first we need to understand what is probability, then we can study conditional probability.}

	    \frametitle{Probability of an Event}
	    \begin{block}{Event}
		Event is an outcome or occurrence that has a probability assigned to it.
		\end{block}
		\begin{block}{Probability of an Event}
		\[
 		  Probability = \frac{\text{The number of wanted outcomes}}{\text{The number of possible outcomes}}
		\]
		\newline
		\newline
		If an experiment can result in any one of N different equally likely outcomes, and if exactly n of these outcomes 			         correspond to event A, then the probability of event A is
		\newline
		\[P(A) = \frac{\text{n}}{\text{N}}, \] \[0 \leq P(A) \leq 1.\]

			Each of the letters HELLO is written on a card. A card is chosen at random from the bag. What is the probability of 				getting the letter 'L'?
		\end{example}
		\begin{alertblock}{Solution}
		Since the card is randomly selected, it means that each card has the same chance of being selected. The sample space for this experiment is;
		\newline
		\[S = \lbrace H, E, L_{1} , L_{2} , O \rbrace\]
		\newline
		There are two cards with the letter 'L'.
		\newline
		\[\text{Let A = event of getting the letter 'L'} = \lbrace  L_{1} , L_{2} \rbrace\]
		\[P(A) = \frac{2}{5} \]

	    \begin{example}
			The names of four directors of a company will be placed in a hat and a 2-member delegation will be selected at random to represent the company at an international meeting. Let A, B, C and D denote the directors of the company. What is the probability that \\
			\begin{enumerate}[i]
			\item A is selected?
			\item A is not selected?
			\end{enumerate}
		\end{example}
		\begin{alertblock}{Solution(i)}
		Firstly, The sample space for this experiment is;
		\[S = \lbrace AB, AC, AD, BC, BD, CD \rbrace\] 
		When we choose A, we must choose one of the remaining 3 directors to go with A. There are;
		\[{4 \choose 2} = 6\]
		possible combinations. 			
		\end{alertblock}
	}
	\frame{
	\begin{alertblock}{Solution(i) cont.}
		Then, the probability that A is selected is;
		\[\frac{{1 \choose 1} \times {3 \choose 1}}{{4 \choose 2}} = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2}\]		
		\end{alertblock}
		\begin{alertblock}{Solution(ii)}
		We found A is selected is $\frac{1}{2}$, then A is not selected is;
		\[1 - \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{2}\]

	\frametitle{Conditional Probability}
	\begin{block}{Conditional Probability}
		Conditional Probability is a probability which measure the probability of one event occurring relative to another occurring.
	\end{block}
	\begin{block}{How to express?}
		If we want to express the probability of one event happening given another one has already happened, we use the $"\mid"$ symbol to mean "given", and we say; 
		\newline
		\newline
		$P(A \mid B) = \text{The probability of A given that we know B has happened.}$
		\end{block}
	}
	\frame{
		\begin{definition}
		If A and B are two events in a sample space S, then the conditional probability of A given B is defined as
		\[P(A \mid B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)} \hspace{0.3cm} \text{when} \hspace{0.2cm} P(B) > 0. \]	
		\end{definition}

	\begin{example}
		Netflix says that(approximately);
		\begin{itemize}
		\item 10,234,231 people watched Zootopia movie on Netflix
		\item 3,110,153 people watched both Zootopia and Monsters movies on Netflix
		\end{itemize}
		What is the probability that a user will watch Zootopia, given that he/she watched Monsters?

	}
	\frame{
		\begin{alertblock}{Solution}
		\[P(A \cap B)= \text{people who watched both Zootopia and Monsters on Netflix}\]
		\[P(B)= \text{people who watched both Zootopia and Monsters on Netflix}\]	
		\newline
		\[P(A \mid B) = \text{?}\]
		\newline
		\[P(A \mid B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)} = \frac{3,110,153}{10,234,231} = 0.30\]
		\end{alertblock}

	\frame{
	\frametitle{Independence}
	\begin{definition}
		Events A and B are independent, if information about one does not affect the other. This is;
		\[P(A \mid B) = P(A) \]
		\[P(B \mid A) = P(B) \]
		This is equivalent to, events A and B are independent if and only if
		\[P(A \cap B) = P(A)P(B) \]
		Therefore, to obtain the probability that two independent events will both occur, we simply find the product of their individual probabilities.	
		\end{definition}
	}
	\frame{
	\frametitle{Multiplication Rule}
	\begin{definition}
		This rule follows directly from the definition of conditional probability;
		\[P(A \cap B) = P(A)P(B \mid A) \]
		or
		\newline
		\[P(A \cap B) = P(B)P(A \mid B) \]
	\end{definition}
	\begin{example}
			What is the probability that two female students will be selected at random to participate in a certain research project, from a class of 7 males and 3 female students?
	\end{example}
	}
	\frame{
		\begin{alertblock}{Solution}
		First we need to define events; Let;
		\newline
		\newline
		A = the first student selected is a female
		\newline
		B = the second student selected is a female
		\newline
		\[P(A \cap B) = P(A)P(B \mid A) = \frac{3}{10} \times \frac{2}{9} = \frac{6}{90}\]
		\[P(A \cap B) = \frac{1}{15}\]
		\end{alertblock}
	}
	\frame{
	\begin{block}{Addition Rule}
		For any two events A and B;
		\[P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \cap B) \]
	\end{block}
	\begin{block}{Probability Trees}
		This is a useful device to calculate probabilities when using the probability rules.

	\begin{example}
		Student G wakes up late on average 3 days in every 5 days. 
		\newline
		\newline
		If G wakes up late, the probability G is late for school = $\frac{9}{10}$ 
		\newline
		\newline
		If G does not wakes up late, the probability G is late for school = $\frac{3}{10}$ 
		\newline
		\newline
		On what percent of days does G get to school on time?
		\newline
	\end{example}
	\begin{alertblock}{Solution}
		The probability G wakes up late = $\frac{3}{5}$ 
		\newline
		\newline
		The probability G wakes up on time = $\frac{2}{5}$

	\begin{alertblock}{Solution cont.}
		Thus, the probability G gets to school on time;
		\[P(G) = \frac{3}{50} + \frac{14}{50} = \frac{17}{50} = \frac{34}{100}\]
		As a result, Student G gets to school on time $34\%$ of the time.

		A Ph.D. graduate has applied for a job with two universities: A and B. The graduate feels that she has a 60\% chance of receiving an offer from university A and a 50\% chance of receiving an offer from university B. If she receives an offer from
university B, she believes that she has an 80\% chance of receiving an offer from university A.

		$P(B \mid E)$ = receiving offer from university B $\mid$ not receiving offer from university A
